why do we need pointers ?
In programming every variable is stored inside a memory(Ram)
Normally a variable stores a value but sometimes we need to know where the value is stored,thi is where the pointers come in.

Real world analogy

🏠 A house = A memory location
👤 Person inside = The value stored
📍 House address = Memory address

A normal variable stores the person 
A pointer stores the adress of the person 

so instead of holding the value a pointers hold the location of a value
in simple words a pointer is a variable that stores the memory adress of another variable 

The importance of Pointers in c++ programming 
pointers are used for 

1.Effecient memory usage
2.passing arguments by refrence 
3.Dynamic memory Allocations 
4.Arrays and data structueres (link ,list ,trees)
5.direct memory access
