Object Oriented programming 

In early programming or procderual programming ,we only focused on varibles and funtions 
But real-world problems are complex.
We need a way to:
Represent real-world entities
Group related data and functions together
Improve security and structure
This is where Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) comes in.
C++ supports OOP using classes and objects.

🚗 Car

A car has:

Properties → color, model, speed

Behaviors → start(), stop(), accelerate()

In programming:

Class = Blueprint of a car

Object = Real car made from that blueprint

You don’t drive a blueprint.
You drive an object.

class => A class is a user defined data types that groups data member and member functions into a single unit 

Object => An object is an instance of a class used to access the data and functions of that class
