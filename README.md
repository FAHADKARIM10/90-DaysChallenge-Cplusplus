# 90 Days of C++ Learning Challenge

This repository contains my **90-day journey of learning C++ from Day 1**.  
Each day I am learning new topics and implementing examples.

## Day-wise Structure
- `Day-01/` : Basics of C++, Hello World, Program Structure
- `Day-02/` : Variables, Data Types, Input/Output
- … and so on

## Objective
- Master C++ fundamentals
- Build consistent learning habit
- Share progress publicly

## Notes
- Only source code (.cpp) files are included
- Executables (.exe) are ignored using `.gitignore`
